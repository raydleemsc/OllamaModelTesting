Based on your description, it sounds like you are referring to a traditional game called "Spinning the Six-Pronged Metal Piece." However, there are a few other names that could potentially fit this description:

1. "Spin the Rose": This game involves spinning a metal rose with six petals, each representing a different action or challenge for the player.

2. "The Spindle Game": Players spin a decorative spindle with six prongs, each of which is assigned a specific value or task.

3. "Six-Pointed Star Spin": In this game, players spin a metal star with six points, each of which represents a different challenge or opportunity for the player.

4. "The Hexagon Spin": The hexagon is a six-sided shape, so spinning a metal hexagon could be the basis for a game with six possible outcomes or challenges.

5. "Six-Pronged Fortune Spinner": This toy might be used for divination or fortune-telling, where each prong represents a different possibility or path to explore.

These are just a few potential names that could fit your description. If you provide more details or context about the game or its origins, I may be able to offer more specific suggestions.
