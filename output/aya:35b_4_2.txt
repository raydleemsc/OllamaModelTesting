Here is a proof by contradiction of the transcendence of the number $e$. Remember that a number is transcendental if it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.

Supose that $e$ is not trascendental, then there exists a polynomial with rational coefficients whose root is $e$. We can always suppose that the polynomial is reduced, so we can write it as:
$$
P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0,
$$
with $a_n \neq 0$, and all coefficients $a_i$ rational.

Now, we can consider the function:
$$
f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{e^x}
$$

This is a continuous function, so it is bounded in the interval $[0, \infty)$ (Weierstrass's theorem). In other words, there exists an M such that for all x greater than 0:
$$
|f(x)| < M
$$

But we know that $P(e) = 0$, so:
$$
|f(e)| = |\frac{P(e)}{e^e}| = \frac{0}{1} = 0
$$

This means that for all x greater than 0:
$$
|\frac{P(x)}{e^x}| < M
$$
or
$$
|P(x)| < |e^x|M
$$

This implies that $|P(x)|$ grows at most linearly, but we know that $|e^x|$ grows exponentially. So for large enough x, the exponential term will be greater than any linear function, which is a contradiction.

Therefore our supposition that $e$ is not trascendental must be false, and so $e$ is trascendental.
