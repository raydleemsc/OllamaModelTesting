Here is a proof by contradiction of the transcendence of the number $e$. Remember that a number is transcendent if it is not the root of a polynomial equation with rational coefficients. 

Let's assume that $e$ is not transcendent, which means there exists a non-zero polynomial equation:

$$P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0$$

with rational coefficients such that:

$$P(e) = 0$$

We can assume without loss of generality that $a_n$ is not zero, because if all the coefficients were zero, then $P(x)$ would be the zero polynomial and its zero would not be interesting. 

Now, let's consider Euler's constant $\gamma$, which is the limit:

$$\gamma = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n$$

We know that $e$ is the unique number such that:

$$\gamma = \lim_{n \to \infty} e^{\frac{1}{n}}$$

This means that for every rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ with $p, q$ integers and $q \neq 0$, we have:

$$|e - \gamma| < \frac{1}{q}$$

if $n$ is sufficiently large. In particular, if we take $n = q$, then:

$$|e - \gamma| < \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{n}$$

This means that for large enough $n$, we have:

$$\left| e - \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \right| < \frac{1}{n}$$

Now, let's consider the polynomial:

$$Q(x) = x^n - \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n$$

We have:

$$Q(e) = e^n - \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n < \frac{1}{n}$$

for large enough $n$. But we also know that:

$$|Q(e)| \geq |e|^n - \left| \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \right| \geq e^n - 1$$

Therefore, for large enough $n$, we have:

$$e^n - 1 < \frac{1}{n}$$

which is clearly false. This contradiction means that our assumption that $e$ is not transcendent must be wrong, so $e$ must be transcendent.
