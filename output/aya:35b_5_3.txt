\section{Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open Set:} A subset $U$ of a topological space $X$ is open if for every point $x \in U$, there exists an open ball $B_x$ such that $x \in B_x \subseteq U$.
    \item \textbf{Closed Set:} A subset $F$ of a topological space $X$ is closed if its complement $X \setminus F$ is open.
    \item \textbf{Topological Space:} A set $X$ along with a collection $\tau$ of subsets called open sets, satisfying certain axioms (T1, T2, and T3).
    \item \textbf{Continuity:} A function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at a point $x \in X$ if for every open set $V$ containing $f(x)$, there exists an open set $U$ such that $x \in U$ and $f(U) \subseteq V$.
    \item \textbf{Connected Space:} A topological space $X$ is connected if it is not the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open sets.
    \item \textbf{Compact Space:} A topological space $X$ is compact if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.
\end{itemize}

\section{Theorems and Corollaries}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Theorems on Open and Closed Sets:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The intersection of finitely many open sets is open.
        \item The union of arbitrarily many closed sets is closed.
        \item If $U$ is open and $F$ is closed in $X$, then $U \cap F$ is closed in $U$ and open in $F$.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Continuity Theorems:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at $x \in X$, then $f(x)$ is in the closure of $f^{-1}(f(x))$.
        \item A function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous on $X$ if and only if for every closed set $F$ in $Y$, its preimage $f^{-1}(F)$ is closed in $X$.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Connectedness Theorems:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A topological space $X$ is connected if and only if it cannot be written as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open sets.
        \item If $X$ is a connected topological space, then any two points in $X$ can be joined by a path.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Compactness Theorems:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $X$ is compact and $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous, then $f(X)$ is compact.
        \item A finite product of compact spaces is compact.
        \item A subspace of a compact space is compact if and only if it is closed.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Additional Results}

Here are some additional important results in topology:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Theorems on Separability: A topological space $X$ is separable if it contains a countable dense subset.
    \item Theorems on Metrizability: A topological space is metrizable if there exists a metric that generates its topology.
    \item The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: If $p(z) = a_nz^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + ... + a_1z + a_0$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients, then $p(z)$ has $n$ roots in the complex plane.
    \item The Jordan-Sch√∂nflies Theorem: A simple closed curve in the plane divides it into an interior and exterior region and vice versa.
\end{itemize}

Remember that this is just a basic cheat sheet, and there are many more definitions, theorems, and corollaries in topology. This document provides a quick reference for some of the most important and commonly used results in the field.
