The closest real-life toy that I can think of that spins a six-pronged object is the cow milk carton spinner: https://www.google.com/search?q=cow+milk+carton+spinner&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS740US740&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR4J7C4K_aAhVItlkKHQnWCU0Q_AUIEigB&biw=1366&bih=657#imgrc=_

Other toys that could be related are:
* a six-sidedspinner, which you can buy at any carnival or party supply store. You spin it on the table and whatever the metal prong lands on will determine what game you get
* roulette wheels, which are used in casinos to pick winners for bets
* a Ferris Wheel that is not an amusement park ride. It is simply large and spins.
