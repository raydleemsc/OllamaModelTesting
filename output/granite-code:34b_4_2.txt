Here's a proof that e is transcendental using Liouville's theorem and the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem.

First, let's recall these two theorems:

Liouville's theorem: If α1, α2, ..., αn are algebraic numbers (not all zero) with the property that there exists a positive integer N such that |αi| < N for each i, then there exists a nonzero polynomial P(x) with rational coefficients such that P(α1) = P(α2) = ... = P(αn) = 0.

Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem: If α1, α2, ..., αn are distinct algebraic numbers, then eα1, eα2, ..., eαn are transcendental.

Now, let's prove that e is transcendental using these two theorems:

Assume for contradiction that e is algebraic. Since e > 0, it must be greater than any positive rational number. Let N be a positive integer such that |e - N| < 1. Then, we can choose n distinct rational numbers r1, r2, ..., rn with |ri - N| < 1/n for each i. Since e is algebraic, there exists a nonzero polynomial P(x) with rational coefficients such that P(e) = 0.

Now, consider the numbers αi = ri - e for i = 2, 3, ..., n. These are distinct algebraic numbers since they are differences of distinct rational numbers and e is algebraic. Moreover, we have |αi| < 1/n for each i. By Liouville's theorem, there exists a nonzero polynomial Q(x) with rational coefficients such that Q(α2) = Q(α3) = ... = Q(αn) = 0.

Let R(x) = P(x)Q(x) - P(e)Q(0). Then, R(x) is a nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients and satisfies R(e) = 0 since both P(e) = 0 and Q(αi) = 0 for i = 2, 3, ..., n. Now, define S(x) = R(x + e). Then, S(x) is a nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients and satisfies S(0) = R(e) = 1 since P(e)Q(0) = P(e) = 1 by definition of Q.

However, this contradicts the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, which states that eαi are transcendental for distinct algebraic numbers αi. In our case, we have α2, α3, ..., αn as distinct algebraic numbers and e as well. Therefore, S(x) must be transcendental, which contradicts the fact that it has rational coefficients and satisfies S(0) = 1.

Hence, our assumption that e is algebraic must be false, and e is indeed transcendental.
