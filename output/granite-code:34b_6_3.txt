To show the transition of a triangle to a circle, we can use Manim's ParametricFunction class, which allows us to create an animation by specifying a mathematical function that describes the shape. In this case, we want to start with a triangle and end up with a circle, so we'll define a function that smoothly transitions between these two shapes.

Here is an example code:

```python
from manim import *

class TriangleToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Define the function for a circle
        def circle_function(t):
            return (0.5 + 1.2*np.cos(t)) * np.array([
                np.cos(t),
                np.sin(t),
                4 * t / TAU
            ])

        # Create a triangle
        triangle = RegularPolygon(n=3, start_angle=-TAU/6)
        triangle.set_color(RED)
        triangle.scale(2)

        # Animate the transformation to a circle
        circle = ParametricFunction(circle_function, t_range=[0, TAU], color=BLUE)
        self.play(ShowCreation(circle))
        self.wait()
```
