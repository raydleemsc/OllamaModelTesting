A nice math question!

The Markov numbers are a sequence of integers that satisfy a certain Diophantine equation. They are named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, who studied them in the late 19th century.

According to various sources, including Wikipedia and OEIS (the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences), the first few Markov numbers are:

1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 34, 89

So, the 7th Markov number is indeed **89**.
