The Markov numbers are a sequence of integers that arise in a variety of mathematical contexts. They can be defined recursively as follows:

M(1) = 1
M(2) = 2
M(n) = 3M(n-1)^2 - M(n-2)

Using this recursion, we find:

M(3) = 5
M(4) = 13
M(5) = 29
M(6) = 34
M(7) = 89

Therefore, the 7th Markov number is 89.
