A nostalgic question!

Based on your description, here are some potential toy matches:

1. **Top**: A classic spinning top is a possibility. However, traditional tops usually have a single pointy end or a rounded base, not 6 prongs.
2. **Dreidel**: This might be the most likely candidate. A dreidel (or dreydl) is a traditional Jewish spinning toy with four sides, but some versions can have six sides or prongs.
3. **Gyroscopic Spinner**: Some gyroscopic toys have multiple arms or prongs that spin around a central axis. These might match your description.
4. **Whirligig**: Whirligigs are spinning toys that often feature multiple blades or arms. While not all whirligigs have 6 prongs, some designs might fit this description.

If none of these options sound familiar, please provide more details or context about the toy you're thinking of, and I'll do my best to help!
