That sounds like a fun and nostalgic toy!

Based on your description, I'm going to take a few guesses at what it might be:

1. **Buzzle**: A classic British toy from the 1960s and 1970s, which consisted of spinning a metal wheel with six prongs.
2. **Whirly Wheel**: A generic name for a similar type of toy that was popular in various countries during the mid-20th century.
3. **Spin-A-Wheel**: Another possible name for this type of toy, where players tried to spin a metal wheel with multiple prongs.

Please let me know if any of these sound like the toy you were thinking of!
