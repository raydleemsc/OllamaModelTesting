A nostalgic question!

Based on your description, here are some potential toy names that might match what you're thinking of:

1. **Top**: A classic spinning top is a simple toy with multiple points or prongs, often made of metal, that spins when given a push.
2. **Spinning Top** (or **Metal Top**): Variants of the traditional top toy could have 6 prongs and be made of metal.
3. **Gyro**: Some gyroscopic toys feature spinning wheels with multiple points or prongs, which might match your description.
4. **Whirligig**: An old-fashioned toy that consists of a spinning wheel with multiple arms or prongs, often made of metal.

Please let me know if any of these resonate with you, or if I can help further refine the possibilities!
