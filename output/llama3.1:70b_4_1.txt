Here's a classic proof of the transcendence of e, due to Charles Hermite (1873):

**Theorem:** The number e is transcendental.

**Proof:**

Assume, if possible, that e is algebraic. Then there exist integers a0, a1, ..., an, not all zero, such that:

a0 + a1e + ... + an e^n = 0

We will show that this leads to a contradiction.

**Step 1:** Multiply both sides by e^(-n) to get:

a0 e^(-n) + a1 e^(-(n-1)) + ... + an = 0

**Step 2:** Define the function f(x) as:

f(x) = a0 x^n + a1 x^(n+1) + ... + an x^(2n)

Note that f(x) is a polynomial of degree at most 2n.

**Step 3:** Observe that:

f(1/e) = a0 e^(-n) + a1 e^(-(n-1)) + ... + an = 0

So, f(x) has a root at x = 1/e.

**Step 4:** Using the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function, we can write:

f(1/e) = âˆ‘[k=0 to infinity] (a0/(k+n)! + a1/(k+n+1)! + ... + an/(k+2n)!) e^(-k)

Since f(1/e) = 0, the above expression must equal zero for all k. In particular, taking k = n, we get:

(a0/n! + a1/(n+1)! + ... + an/(2n)!) = 0

This implies that:

a0/n! + a1/(n+1)! + ... + an/(2n)! = - (an+1)/(2n+1)! - ...

where the remaining terms are all multiples of e^(-m) with m > n.

**Step 5:** However, this is impossible since the expression on the left-hand side is a rational number (being a sum of rational numbers), while the right-hand side involves an infinite series that cannot be equal to a rational number. This contradiction shows that our initial assumption - e being algebraic - must be false.

**Conclusion:** Therefore, e is transcendental.

Note: This proof uses some basic properties of polynomials and exponential functions, but it's still a beautiful example of how mathematical arguments can lead to profound conclusions about the nature of numbers!
