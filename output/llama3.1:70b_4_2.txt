A classic result in number theory!

Here's a proof of the transcendence of e:

**Theorem:** The number e is transcendental.

**Proof:**

We will use a proof by contradiction, assuming that e is algebraic and then deriving a contradiction.

Assume that e is algebraic. Then there exist integers a0, a1, ..., an such that:

a0 + a1e + ... + ane^n = 0

where a0 ≠ 0 (since e is not a root of unity).

Now, we can find a positive integer k such that:

k ≥ |an|, |an-1|, ..., |a1|

Multiply the equation by k! to get:

ka0 + ka1e + ... + kan!e^n = 0

Note that all coefficients are now integers.

**Claim:** We can choose an integer m > n such that:

m ≥ k
m! is not divisible by any of a0, ..., an

This claim is easily verified: since there are only finitely many prime factors among a0, ..., an, we can simply choose m large enough to be larger than all these primes.

Now, consider the number N = e^m. We have:

|N - (1 + 1/1! + ... + 1/m!)| < 1/(m+1)!

This is because the Taylor series of e^x converges absolutely and uniformly on [0,m]. In particular, we can write:

e^m = (1 + 1/1! + ... + 1/m!) + R_m

where |R_m| < 1/(m+1)!.

Now, multiply our original equation by N to get:

ka0N + ka1Ne + ... + kan!Ne^n = 0

Using the fact that e^m is close to (1 + 1/1! + ... + 1/m!), we can substitute this expression for Ne into the above equation and rearrange terms:

(kan!/(m+1)!)R_m + (smaller terms) = 0

The coefficient of R_m, namely kan!/(m+1)!, is an integer. However, since |R_m| < 1/(m+1)!, we have that the entire left-hand side must be zero.

In particular, this implies that:

kan!/(m+1)! = 0

This is a contradiction, since m was chosen large enough to ensure that (m+1)! is not divisible by any of an, ..., a0.

Therefore, our assumption that e is algebraic must have been false. Hence, e is transcendental.
