Here is a LuaLaTeX cheat sheet for basic topology:

**Topology Cheat Sheet**

**Definitions**

* **Topological Space**: A set $X$ together with a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$, called open sets, satisfying:
	+ The empty set and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$
	+ The union of any collection of sets in $\mathcal{T}$ is also in $\mathcal{T}$
	+ The intersection of any two sets in $\mathcal{T}$ is also in $\mathcal{T}$
* **Closed Set**: A set $A \subseteq X$ whose complement $X \setminus A$ is open
* **Neighborhood**: An open set containing a point $x \in X$
* **Interior**: The largest open set contained in a given set $A$, denoted $\mathrm{int}(A)$
* **Closure**: The smallest closed set containing a given set $A$, denoted $\overline{A}$
* **Boundary**: The set of points in the closure of $A$ but not in its interior, denoted $\partial A$

**Theorems**

* **Compactness Theorem**: Every open cover of a compact space has a finite subcover
* **Connectedness Theorem**: A space is connected if and only if it cannot be written as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets
* **Urysohn's Lemma**: For any two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, there exists a continuous function $f: X \to [0,1]$ such that $f(A) = 0$ and $f(B) = 1$
* **Tietze Extension Theorem**: If $X$ is a normal space and $F$ is a closed subset of $X$, then every continuous function from $F$ to $\mathbb{R}$ can be extended to a continuous function on all of $X$

**Corollaries**

* **Heine-Borel Theorem**: A subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded
* **Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem**: Every infinite bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a limit point

This code uses the `amsmath` package to format mathematical equations and environments. You can customize the appearance of the cheat sheet by modifying the LuaLaTeX code.

Note: This is just a basic example, you may want to add more definitions, theorems and corollaries, or change the formatting to suit your needs.
