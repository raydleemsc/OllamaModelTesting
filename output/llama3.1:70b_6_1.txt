Here is a simple example of a Manim animation that shows the transition of a triangle to a circle:
```python
from manim import *

class TriangleToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a triangle
        triangle = Polygon(np.array([-1, -1, 0]), np.array([1, -1, 0]), np.array([0, 1, 0]))
        self.play(ShowCreation(triangle))

        # Animate the transition to a circle
        for i in range(100):
            angle = i / 10.0
            new_vertices = []
            for j in range(3):
                x = triangle.get_vertices()[j][0] + (1 - np.cos(angle)) * np.sin(j * 2 * PI / 3)
                y = triangle.get_vertices()[j][1] + (1 - np.cos(angle)) * np.cos(j * 2 * PI / 3)
                new_vertices.append(np.array([x, y, 0]))
            new_polygon = Polygon(*new_vertices)
            self.play(Transform(triangle, new_polygon))

        # Show the final circle
        circle = Circle(radius=1)
        self.play(Replace(triangle, circle))
        self.wait()
```
This code creates a scene with a triangle that morphs into a circle over time. The `ShowCreation` method is used to show the initial triangle, and then a loop is used to animate the transformation of the triangle into a circle by adjusting its vertices.

Here's how it works:

* We start with a triangle created using the `Polygon` class.
* In each iteration of the loop, we calculate new vertex positions for the triangle based on an angle that increases over time. The new vertex positions are calculated using a combination of sine and cosine functions to create a circular motion.
* We use the `Transform` method to animate the transformation of the triangle into a circle by replacing its vertices with the new ones.
* After the loop finishes, we show the final circle using the `Replace` method.

You can customize this animation by adjusting the timing, speed, and other parameters. For example, you could add a `rate_func` parameter to the `Transform` method to control the easing of the animation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
