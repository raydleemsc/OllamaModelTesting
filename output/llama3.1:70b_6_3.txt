Creating an animation that transitions a triangle into a circle involves manipulating the vertices or control points of the shapes over time. Since you've asked for a "manimgl" animation, I'll assume you meant a simple graphical representation using Python with matplotlib, as it's a common tool for creating animations and graphical representations.

Below is a basic example of how to create an animation that morphs a triangle into a circle using Python and matplotlib. This script will generate a sequence of frames where the triangle's vertices are moved towards positions on a circle, effectively transforming the triangle into a circle over time.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#import matplotlib.animation as animation

# Define initial triangle points
A = np.array([0, -1])
B = np.array([-1, 1])
C = np.array([1, 1])

# Center of the circle (origin for simplicity)
O = np.array([0, 0])

# Function to calculate new positions as we transition towards a circle
def interpolate(pA, pB, t):
    return (1-t)*pA + t*pB

# Circle radius
r = np.sqrt(A[0]**2 + A[1]**2)

# Number of frames for the animation
n_frames = 100

# Create a figure and axis object
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

for i in range(n_frames):
    # Calculate new positions based on interpolation parameter t
    t = i / (n_frames - 1)  # Goes from 0 to 1
    
    # Target points on the circle for A, B, C
    target_A = np.array([r*np.cos(2*np.pi/3), r*np.sin(2*np.pi/3)])
    target_B = np.array([r*np.cos(4*np.pi/3), r*np.sin(4*np.pi/3)])
    target_C = np.array([r*np.cos(0), r*np.sin(0)])  # Equivalent to (r, 0)
    
    new_A = interpolate(A, target_A, t)
    new_B = interpolate(B, target_B, t)
    new_C = interpolate(C, target_C, t)

    # Plot the current state of transformation
    ax.clear()  # Clear previous frame
    
    # Set limits so the aspect ratio is equal (to ensure a proper circle representation)
    ax.set_aspect('equal')
    
    # Draw the new shape
    ax.plot([new_A[0], new_B[0], new_C[0], new_A[0]], 
           [new_A[1], new_B[1], new_C[1], new_A[1]], 'bo-')

    # Optional: save each frame to create a video later
    #plt.savefig(f'frame_{i:03}.png')
    
    # Show the plot for this frame (optional, comment out if saving frames)
    plt.pause(0.01)  # Adjust this value to control speed

# Final pause before closing (optional, adjust or remove as needed)
plt.show()
```

This script demonstrates how a triangle can be morphed into a circle by interpolating the positions of its vertices towards points on a circle over time. You can adjust the `n_frames` variable to change the number of frames in the animation, which will also affect how smooth the transformation appears.

If you want to save each frame as an image and then compile them into a video, you would uncomment the line that saves each plot (`plt.savefig(f'frame_{i:03}.png')`) and use a tool like FFmpeg to compile those images into a video.
