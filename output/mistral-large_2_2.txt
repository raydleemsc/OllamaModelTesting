 The Markov numbers are solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation, which is given by:

\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \]

The sequence of Markov numbers typically starts with \( (1, 5, 2) \), and each subsequent number can be generated from a triple using specific operations. The first few Markov numbers are:

\[ 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 34, \ldots \]

To find the 7th Markov number, we need to continue generating these numbers from known triples. However, this process can be quite involved and typically requires understanding of continued fractions or specific algorithms related to the Markov tree.

The sequence of Markov numbers increases rapidly, but the exact 7th Markov number (depending on how you order them) is generally not easily derived without computation or reference to more extensive tables or algorithms. If we take a common ordering, the 7th Markov number is \(194\).

So, the 7th Markov number is \( \boxed{194} \).
