 The toy you're describing sounds like it could be one of the following:

1. **Spinning Top**: Some spinning tops have a six-pronged or star-shaped base. They are spun on a flat surface and can continue spinning for a long time.

2. **Astrojax**: While not exactly six-pronged, Astrojax is a skill toy consisting of three balls connected by a string, which can create complex spinning patterns that might remind some of a six-pronged shape in motion.

3. **Jack**: Also known as "Jacks," this traditional children's game involves tossing and catching a small ball while picking up small metal or plastic pieces called jacks. Some variations of the jacks can have six prongs.

4. **Ninja Star**: While not typically considered a toy, some spinning ninja stars (shuriken) have a six-pronged design. They are often used in martial arts practice and sometimes as toys for older children or adults.

5. **Fidget Spinner**: Some variations of fidget spinners can have a six-pronged shape, though they are usually simpler in design with two or three prongs.
