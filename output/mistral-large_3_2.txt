 The toy you're describing sounds like it could be one of the following:

1. **Fidget Spinner**: While traditional fidget spinners have two or three prongs, there are variations that have six prongs. These toys are designed to spin around a central bearing.

2. **Spinning Top**: Some spinning tops have multiple prongs or points at the base. Although they typically have fewer than six, custom designs could match your description.

3. **Jacob's Ladder (toy)**: This is an old-fashioned toy consisting of blocks connected by ribbons, which can be manipulated to create a cascading effect. While it doesn't spin in the traditional sense, it involves flipping and moving parts that could be misremembered as spinning.

4. **Star Spinner**: This is a type of fidget toy designed with multiple prongs (sometimes six) that spin around a central axis. It's similar to a fidget spinner but often has a more complex shape.

5. **Windmill Toy**: Some windmill toys have six blades or prongs and can be spun by hand or when exposed to wind.

6. **Buzz Saw (toy)**: This is an older toy that consists of a spinning disc with multiple points, resembling a saw blade. It spins on a central axis and makes a buzzing sound as it rotates.
