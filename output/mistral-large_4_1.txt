 Proving the transcendence of \(e\) (the base of the natural logarithm) is quite involved and requires some advanced mathematical concepts. The first proof was given by Charles Hermite in 1873. Here, I'll outline a simplified version of the proof using some basic ideas from calculus and algebra.

### Proof Outline

1. **Assume \(e\) is Algebraic:**
   Suppose \(e\) is an algebraic number. This means that there exists a non-zero polynomial \(P(x)\) with integer coefficients such that \(P(e) = 0\). Let the degree of this polynomial be \(n\).

2. **Constructing an Auxiliary Function:**
   Define an auxiliary function \(f(x)\) as follows:
   \[
   f(x) = \frac{x^{p-1}(x-1)^p(x-2)^p \cdots (x-n)^p}{(p-1)!}
   \]
   where \(p\) is a prime number. This function is chosen such that its derivatives at the points \(0, 1, 2, ..., n\) are integers and divisible by large powers of \(p\).

3. **Analyzing the Derivatives:**
   Consider the sum:
   \[
   F(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} f^{(i)}(x) P^{(i)}(e - x)
   \]
   where \(f^{(i)}\) and \(P^{(i)}\) denote the \(i\)-th derivatives of \(f\) and \(P\), respectively.

4. **Evaluating at Specific Points:**
   Evaluate \(F(x)\) at \(x = 0, 1, 2, ..., n\). Since \(e\) is a root of \(P(x)\), we have:
   \[
   F(k) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} f^{(i)}(k) P^{(i)}(e - k) = 0
   \]
   for \(k = 1, 2, ..., n\).

5. **Non-Zero Evaluation at Zero:**
   However, at \(x = 0\), the evaluation of \(F(0)\) is non-zero and can be shown to be an integer not divisible by \(p\) for sufficiently large \(p\). This leads to a contradiction because all terms in the sum should ideally cancel out if \(e\) were algebraic.

6. **Conclusion:**
   Since we have arrived at a contradiction, our initial assumption that \(e\) is algebraic must be false. Therefore, \(e\) is transcendental.

### Detailed Steps and Calculations

The detailed proof involves carefully analyzing the function \(f(x)\) and its derivatives, as well as using properties of polynomials and their roots. The key idea is that the auxiliary function \(F(x)\) can be constructed such that it has certain integer properties at specific points, leading to a contradiction when evaluated under the assumption that \(e\) is algebraic.

This proof relies on advanced concepts in number theory and analysis, including the use of derivatives, factorials, and prime numbers. It's a beautiful example of how different branches of mathematics can be combined to prove deep results about the nature of numbers.
