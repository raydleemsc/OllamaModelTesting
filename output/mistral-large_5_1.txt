\section*{Definitions}

\begin{definition}[Topological Space]
A \textbf{topological space} is an ordered pair $(X, \tau)$, where $X$ is a set and $\tau$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, satisfying the following conditions:
1. $\emptyset \in \tau$ and $X \in \tau$.
2. The union of any number of sets in $\tau$ is also in $\tau$.
3. The intersection of any finite number of sets in $\tau$ is also in $\tau$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open Set]
In a topological space $(X, \tau)$, the elements of $\tau$ are called \textbf{open sets}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closed Set]
A subset $A$ of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is \textbf{closed} if its complement, $X \setminus A$, is open.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Neighborhood]
Let $x \in X$. A \textbf{neighborhood} of $x$ is a subset $V$ of $X$ such that there exists an open set $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq V$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Limit Point]
A point $x \in X$ is a \textbf{limit point} (or accumulation point) of a subset $A \subseteq X$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one point of $A$ different from $x$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closure]
The \textbf{closure} of a set $A$, denoted $\overline{A}$, is the smallest closed set that contains $A$. It can also be defined as the union of $A$ and its limit points.
\end{definition}

\section*{Theorems}

\begin{theorem}[Union of Open Sets]
The arbitrary union of open sets is open.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Intersection of Closed Sets]
The arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Characterization of Closure]
A point $x$ belongs to the closure $\overline{A}$ if and only if every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$.
\end{theorem}

\section*{Corollaries}

\begin{corollary}[Finite Intersection Property]
The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[Complement of Open Set]
The complement of an open set in $X$ is closed.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[Closure and Limit Points]
A set $A$ is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points.
\end{corollary}
