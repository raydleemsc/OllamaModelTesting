\section{Definitions}

\begin{definition}[Topological Space]
    A \textbf{topological space} is an ordered pair $(X, \tau)$, where $X$ is a set and $\tau$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, satisfying:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item $\emptyset \in \tau$ and $X \in \tau$.
        \item The union of any collection of sets in $\tau$ is also in $\tau$.
        \item The intersection of any finite collection of sets in $\tau$ is also in $\tau$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open Set]
    In a topological space $(X, \tau)$, the elements of $\tau$ are called \textbf{open sets}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closed Set]
    A subset $A$ of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is \textbf{closed} if its complement $X \setminus A$ is open.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Neighborhood]
    A \textbf{neighborhood} of a point $x$ in a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is an open set containing $x$.
\end{definition}

\section{Theorems}

\begin{theorem}[Basis for a Topology]
    If $X$ is a nonempty set and $\mathcal{B}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item For each $x \in X$, there exists at least one basis element containing $x$.
        \item If $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$ where $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$, then there is a $B_3 \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Then $\mathcal{B}$ forms a basis for some topology on $X$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Closure of a Set]
    The closure of a set $A$ in a topological space $(X, \tau)$, denoted by $\overline{A}$, is the smallest closed set containing $A$. Equivalently, it is the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Corollaries}

\begin{corollary}[Closure Properties]
    Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space and let $A$ be a subset of $X$. Then:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item $\overline{\emptyset} = \emptyset$ and $\overline{X} = X$.
        \item $A \subseteq \overline{A}$.
        \item If $A \subseteq B$, then $\overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[Intersection of Closed Sets]
    The intersection of any collection of closed sets is also a closed set.
\end{corollary}
