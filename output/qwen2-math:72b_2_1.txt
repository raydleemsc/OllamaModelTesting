To find the 7th Markov number, we need to understand the sequence of Markov numbers. The Markov numbers are generated by the solutions to the Markov equation:

\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \]

The smallest Markov number is 1. The next few Markov numbers can be found using the recurrence relation derived from the properties of the Markov equation. However, for simplicity, we can list the first few Markov numbers directly: 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 70, 169, ...

We are interested in the 7th Markov number. By listing them out, we see that the sequence is as follows:

1. 1
2. 2
3. 5
4. 13
5. 29
6. 70
7. 169

Therefore, the 7th Markov number is \(\boxed{169}\).
