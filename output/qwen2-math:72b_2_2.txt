To determine the 7th Markov number, we first need to understand what Markov numbers are. Markov numbers are a sequence of integers that arise in number theory and have applications in various mathematical fields.

The sequence starts with \( x_1 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 1 \), and \( x_3 = 2 \). Each subsequent term is given by the recurrence relation:
\[
x_{n+1} = x_n + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i^2
\]

Let's calculate the first few terms step-by-step to find the 7th Markov number.

1. \( x_1 = 1 \)
2. \( x_2 = 1 \)
3. \( x_3 = 2 \)

For \( x_4 \):
\[
x_4 = x_3 + x_2^2 + x_1^2 = 2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
\]

For \( x_5 \):
\[
x_5 = x_4 + x_3^2 + x_2^2 + x_1^2 = 4 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10
\]

For \( x_6 \):
\[
x_6 = x_5 + x_4^2 + x_3^2 + x_2^2 + x_1^2 = 10 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 10 + 16 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 32
\]

For \( x_7 \):
\[
x_7 = x_6 + x_5^2 + x_4^2 + x_3^2 + x_2^2 + x_1^2 = 32 + 10^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 32 + 100 + 16 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 154
\]

Thus, the 7th Markov number is:
\[
\boxed{154}
\]
