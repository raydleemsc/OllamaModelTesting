To determine the 7th Markov number, we first need to understand what Markov numbers are. Markov numbers are positive integers \( x, y, z \) that satisfy the Markov equation:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz
\]

The sequence of Markov numbers can be generated using a specific algorithm. Starting with the initial triple \((1, 1, 1)\), we generate new triples by applying transformations. The smallest Markov number in each triple is then added to our sequence.

Let's start generating the Markov numbers step by step:

1. **Initial Triple:**
   \[
   (1, 1, 1)
   \]
   Smallest Markov number: \(1\)

2. **Next Triple:**
   We use the transformation:
   \[
   (x, y, z) \rightarrow (x, y, 3xy - z)
   \]
   Applying this to \((1, 1, 1)\):
   \[
   (1, 1, 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 - 1) = (1, 1, 2)
   \]
   Smallest Markov number: \(1\)

3. **Next Triple:**
   Applying the transformation again:
   \[
   (1, 2, 5)
   \]
   Smallest Markov number: \(1\)

4. **Next Triple:**
   Applying the transformation:
   \[
   (5, 2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 5, 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 - 1) = (2, 5, 29)
   \]
   Smallest Markov number: \(2\)

5. **Next Triple:**
   Applying the transformation:
   \[
   (2, 29, 47)
   \]
   Smallest Markov number: \(2\)

6. **Next Triple:**
   Applying the transformation:
   \[
   (29, 169)
   \]
   Smallest Markov number: \(5\)

7. **Next Triple:**
   Applying the transformation:
   \[
   (5, 13) = (29, 433)
   \]
   Smallest Markov number: \(5\)

8. **Next Triple:**
   Applying the transformation:
   \[
   (169, 194) = (29, 169)
   \]
   Smallest Markov number: \(2\)

To find the sequence of distinct smallest Markov numbers:
\[
1, 2, 5, 13
\]

We need to list these in increasing order:
\[
1, 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 47 = 10th Markov number
\]

The sequence of distinct smallest Markov numbers up to the 8th position is:
\]
 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 47, 169, 985, 47
 \boxed{985}
