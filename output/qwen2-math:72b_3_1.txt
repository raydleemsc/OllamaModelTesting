The toy you are describing sounds like it could be a "spinner" or a "top". These are both types of toys that involve spinning a weighted object on an axis, and they have been popular for many years. The 6 pronged metal piece you mentioned could be the spinner itself, or it could be a replacement part for a spinner that has become damaged or lost. It is also possible that the toy you are thinking of is a type of fidget spinner, which is a recent trend in toys that involves spinning a weighted object on an axis to help with anxiety or stress.
