The toy you are describing sounds like it could be a "spinner" or a "top". These are traditional toys that involve spinning a weighted object on an axis, and they can be made from a variety of materials including metal. The 6 pronged metal piece you mentioned could potentially be the main component of either of these types of toys.
Another possibility is that the toy you are thinking of is a "knight spinner", which is a type of fidget spinner that has six prongs instead of three. Knight spinners were popular in the early 2010s as a stress relief and desk toy, and they often featured intricate metal designs.
It's also worth noting that there may be other toys that use a similar concept but have different names or slight variations in design. Without more specific details, it's difficult to determine exactly which toy you are referring to.
