To prove that \( e \) (Euler's number) is transcendental, we will use a famous theorem known as **Hermite's Theorem**. This theorem states that \( e^a \) is transcendental for any non-zero algebraic number \( a \).

We will proceed with the proof in several steps:

### Step 1: Understanding Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers
- **Algebraic Number**: A number is algebraic if it is a root of some non-zero polynomial equation with integer (or equivalently, rational) coefficients.
- **Transcendental Number**: A number is transcendental if it is not algebraic.

### Step 2: State Hermite's Theorem
**Hermite's Theorem**: If \( a \) is a non-zero algebraic number, then \( e^a \) is transcendental.

### Step 3: Apply Hermite's Theorem to \( e \)
- Let \( a = 1 \). Note that 1 is an algebraic number because it is a root of the polynomial equation \( x - 1 = 0 \).

### Step 4: Conclude the Transcendence of \( e \)
- According to Hermite's Theorem, since 1 is a non-zero algebraic number, \( e^1 = e \) must be transcendental.

Thus, we have shown that \( e \) is transcendental. Therefore, the final result is:

\[
\boxed{e \text{ is transcendental}}
\]
