The transcendence of \(e\) is a deep result in number theory, and proving it requires some advanced mathematical techniques. Here's a high-level outline of one way to prove that \(e\) is transcendental.

### Step 1: Liouville's Theorem
First, we need to state Liouville's Theorem, which provides a criterion for determining whether a number is transcendental.

**Liouville's Theorem**: If a real or complex number \(\alpha\) has the property that for every positive integer \(n\), there exist integers \(p\) and \(q\) with \(q > 1\) such that
\[ \left| \alpha - \frac{p}{q} \right| < \frac{1}{q^n}, \]
then \(\alpha\) is transcendental.

### Step 2: Constructing Rational Approximations to \(e\)
We will show that \(e\) satisfies the condition of Liouville's Theorem. To do this, we need to construct rational approximations to \(e\) that are "too good" to be true for an algebraic number.

Consider the exponential function \(e^x\). For any positive integer \(n\), define
\[ P_n(x) = \frac{x^n}{n!}. \]

Now, consider the partial sums of the Taylor series expansion of \(e^x\):
\[ S_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{x^k}{k!}. \]

### Step 3: Approximation Properties
We have:
\[ e = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!} = S_n(1) + R_n, \]
where \(R_n\) is the remainder term:
\[ R_n = \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}. \]

### Step 4: Estimating the Remainder
We can estimate \(R_n\):
\[ 0 < R_n < \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(n+1)^{k-n}} = \frac{1}{(n+1)!} + \frac{1}{(n+2)!} + \frac{1}{(n+3)!} + \cdots < \frac{1}{(n+1)!} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} + \cdots \right) = \frac{1}{(n+1)!} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{n+1}} = \frac{1}{(n+1)!} \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} = \frac{1}{n!}. \]

### Step 5: Rational Approximation
Let \(P_n\) and \(Q_n\) be defined as:
\[ P_n = n! S_n(1) = n! \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k!} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{n!}{k!}, \]
which is an integer, and
\[ Q_n = n!. \]

Then,
\[ \left| e - \frac{P_n}{Q_n} \right| = \left| e - S_n(1) \right| = R_n < \frac{1}{n!}. \]

### Step 6: Applying Liouville's Theorem
For any positive integer \(n\), we have:
\[ \left| e - \frac{P_n}{Q_n} \right| < \frac{1}{Q_n^n}. \]

Since \(Q_n = n!\), it is clear that for sufficiently large \(n\), this inequality holds. Therefore, by Liouville's Theorem, \(e\) must be transcendental.

### Conclusion
Thus, we have shown that \(e\) satisfies the conditions of Liouville's Theorem and hence is transcendental.

\[
\boxed{\text{e is transcendental}}
\]
