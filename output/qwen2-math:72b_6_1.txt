To create an animation in ManimGL that shows the transition of a triangle to a circle, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install ManimGL by following the instructions on the [Manim website](https://www.manim.community/docs/installation/).
2. Create a new Python script and import the necessary classes from ManimGL.

Here's a simple example of how to create an animation that shows the transition of a triangle to a circle:

```python
from manimlib.imports import *

class TriangleToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a triangle
        triangle = Polygon(
            np.array([-2, -1, 0]),
            np.array([2, -1, 0]),
            np.array([0, 2, 0]),
            color=BLUE,
        )
        
        # Create a circle with the same area as the triangle
        base = 4
        height = 3
        area = (base * height) / 2
        radius = math.sqrt(area / math.pi)
        circle = Circle(radius=radius, color=RED)

        # Center the shapes on the screen
        triangle.shift(DOWN)
        circle.shift(DOWN)

        # Animate the transition from triangle to circle
        self.play(ReplacementTransform(triangle, circle))

        # Display the circle
        self.wait(3)
```

This script creates a scene called `TriangleToCircle` that contains a blue triangle and a red circle. The triangle is transformed into the circle using the `ReplacementTransform` method, which animates the transition between the two shapes.

Save your script as `triangle_to_circle.py` and run it using the following command:

```
manimgl triangle_to_circle.py
```

This will generate an animation that shows the transition of a triangle to a circle. You can adjust the color, size, and duration of the animation by modifying the relevant parameters in the code.
