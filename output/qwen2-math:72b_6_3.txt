To create an animation that shows the transition of a triangle to a circle using ManimGL, you can follow these steps:

1. Install ManimGL by following the instructions on the official Manim documentation website.
2. Create a new Python file and import the necessary classes from ManimGL.
3. Define a custom shape class that interpolates between a triangle and a circle.
4. Create an animation scene that uses the custom shape class to show the transition.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this process:
```python
from manimlib.imports import *

class TriangleToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Define the initial triangle shape
        triangle = Polygon(
            np.array([-2, -1, 0]),
            np.array([2, -1, 0]),
            np.array([0, 3, 0])
        )
        triangle.set_color(BLUE)

        # Define the final circle shape
        circle = Circle(radius=2)
        circle.set_color(RED)

        # Interpolate between the triangle and the circle
        self.play(
            Transform(triangle, circle),
            run_time=5
        )

        # Display the final circle
        self.wait(1)
```

In this example, we define a custom `TriangleToCircle` scene that creates a blue triangle and a red circle. We then use the `Transform` animation to interpolate between the two shapes over a period of 5 seconds. Finally, we display the final circle for 1 second using the `wait` method.

Note that this is just one way to achieve the desired effect. You can customize the interpolation and animation parameters as needed to create the exact transition you want.
