Markov numbers are part of a sequence that arises from solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation:

\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \]

These numbers can be generated through a recursive process or by solving the above equation. The first few Markov numbers are 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 34, 89, and so on.

The 7th Markov number is **89**.
