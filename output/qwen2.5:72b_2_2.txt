Markov numbers are integers that appear in solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation:

\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \]

The sequence of Markov numbers starts with \(1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 34, 89, \ldots\).

To find the 7th Markov number, we can list the first few Markov numbers:

1. 1
2. 2
3. 5
4. 13
5. 29
6. 34
7. 89

Thus, the 7th Markov number is **89**.
