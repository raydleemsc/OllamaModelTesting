Markov numbers are part of a set of positive integers that solve the Markov Diophantine equation:

\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \]

The sequence of Markov numbers starts with \(1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 34, 89, \ldots\).

To find the 7th Markov number, we can list the first few terms:

1. \(1\)
2. \(2\)
3. \(5\)
4. \(13\)
5. \(29\)
6. \(34\)
7. **89**

Thus, the 7th Markov number is **89**.
