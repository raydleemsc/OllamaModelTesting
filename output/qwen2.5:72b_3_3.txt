The toy you're describing, which involves spinning a six-pronged metal piece, is most likely a type of top or spinner. Here are a few potential toys that match your description:

1. **Whirligig** - A whirligig can come in various forms, but one common type is a flat, circular piece with holes around the edge. When you pull a string through these holes, it causes the toy to spin rapidly.

2. **Buzzsaw or Whizzing Top** - This is a type of top that has multiple prongs or blades. When spun, it can create a buzzing sound and visually interesting patterns.

3. **Catherine Wheel** - Although typically associated with fireworks, a Catherine wheel can also refer to a spinning toy with multiple arms or prongs that spin when propelled.

4. **Pinwheel** - While usually made of paper, some metal versions exist. A pinwheel has several blades that catch the wind and spin around.

5. **Spinning Top** - There are various types of spinning tops, some of which can have multiple prongs or points to create different spinning effects.

If none of these names ring a bell, it might be helpful to provide more details about the toy's appearance or how it was played with.
