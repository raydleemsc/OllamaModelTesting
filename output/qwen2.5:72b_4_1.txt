Certainly! Proving that \( e \) is a transcendental number (i.e., it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients) is a significant result in mathematics. The first complete proof was given by Charles Hermite in 1873. Here, I'll outline the key steps and ideas behind this proof.

### Proof Outline

1. **Definition and Properties**:
   - \( e \) is defined as \( e = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \).
   - We need to show that there does not exist a non-zero polynomial \( P(x) \) with integer coefficients such that \( P(e) = 0 \).

2. **Hermite's Approach**:
   - Assume, for contradiction, that \( e \) is algebraic. Then there exists a non-zero polynomial \( P(x) \) with integer coefficients such that \( P(e) = 0 \).
   - Let \( P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n \).

3. **Constructing an Auxiliary Function**:
   - Define the auxiliary function \( f(t) = t^{n+1} Q(e^t) e^{-t} \), where \( Q(x) \) is a polynomial to be determined.
   - The goal is to construct \( Q(x) \) such that certain integrals involving \( f(t) \) are integers, leading to a contradiction.

4. **Integral Representation**:
   - Consider the integral \( I = \int_0^1 f(t) \, dt \).
   - By integrating by parts repeatedly, we can express \( I \) in terms of values of \( P(x) \) and its derivatives at \( e \).

5. **Bounding the Integral**:
   - Show that \( I \) is an integer.
   - Estimate \( |I| \) to show that it must be very small, leading to a contradiction because \( I \) cannot be both an integer and very close to zero.

### Detailed Proof

1. **Assume \( e \) is Algebraic**:
   - Suppose \( P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n \) with \( P(e) = 0 \).

2. **Construct the Polynomial \( Q(x) \)**:
   - Let \( Q(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k x^k \), where \( b_k \) are integers to be determined.
   - Define \( f(t) = t^{n+1} Q(e^t) e^{-t} \).

3. **Integral Representation**:
   - Consider the integral \( I = \int_0^1 f(t) \, dt \).
   - By integrating by parts repeatedly, we get:
     \[
     I = \sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n+1} (-1)^{n+1-j} \frac{P^{(j)}(e)}{j!} \right)
     \]
   - Since \( P(e) = 0 \), the terms involving \( P(e) \) and its derivatives at \( e \) can be simplified.

4. **Bounding the Integral**:
   - Show that \( I \) is an integer by choosing \( Q(x) \) appropriately.
   - Estimate \( |I| \) using the fact that \( e^t \) is bounded on \([0, 1]\).
   - For large enough \( n \), the integral \( I \) becomes very small, leading to a contradiction because \( I \) cannot be both an integer and very close to zero.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The assumption that \( e \) is algebraic leads to a contradiction.
   - Therefore, \( e \) must be transcendental.

This proof sketch outlines the key steps in Hermite's proof of the transcendence of \( e \). The full details involve careful estimates and manipulations of the integrals, but the core idea is to show that assuming \( e \) is algebraic leads to a contradiction.
