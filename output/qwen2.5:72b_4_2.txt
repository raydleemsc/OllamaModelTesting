Certainly! The proof that the number \( e \) (Euler's number, approximately 2.71828...) is transcendental is quite intricate and relies on advanced concepts from algebraic number theory and complex analysis. Here, I'll outline a simplified version of the proof using Hermite's method, which was later refined by Charles Hermite and Ferdinand von Lindemann.

### Definitions and Preliminaries

1. **Algebraic Number**: A number is algebraic if it is a root of a non-zero polynomial equation with integer (or equivalently, rational) coefficients.
2. **Transcendental Number**: A number is transcendental if it is not algebraic.

### Theorem: \( e \) is Transcendental

**Proof by Contradiction**:
Assume that \( e \) is algebraic. Then there exists a non-zero polynomial \( P(x) \) with integer coefficients such that:

\[
P(e) = 0
\]

Let's denote this polynomial as:

\[
P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
\]

where \( a_i \) are integers and \( a_n \neq 0 \).

### Step 1: Construct an Auxiliary Function

Consider the function:

\[
f(x) = \frac{x^n (x - 1)^n (x - 2)^n \cdots (x - m)^n}{n!}
\]

where \( m \) is a positive integer to be determined later. This function is designed to have certain properties that will help in the proof.

### Step 2: Evaluate Integrals

We need to evaluate the integral:

\[
I = \int_0^1 f(x) e^{(m+1)x} \, dx
\]

First, note that \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree \( mn \). We can express \( f(x) \) as:

\[
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{mn} c_k x^k
\]

where \( c_k \) are constants. Therefore,

\[
I = \int_0^1 \left( \sum_{k=0}^{mn} c_k x^k \right) e^{(m+1)x} \, dx
\]

Using integration by parts repeatedly, we can show that:

\[
I = \sum_{k=0}^{mn} c_k \int_0^1 x^k e^{(m+1)x} \, dx
\]

Each integral of the form \( \int_0^1 x^k e^{(m+1)x} \, dx \) can be expressed as a linear combination of \( e \), \( e^2 \), ..., \( e^{m+1} \).

### Step 3: Contradiction

Now, consider the polynomial \( P(x) \) evaluated at \( e \):

\[
P(e) = a_n e^n + a_{n-1} e^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 e + a_0
\]

Since \( P(e) = 0 \), we have:

\[
a_n e^n + a_{n-1} e^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 e + a_0 = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by \( I \):

\[
I (a_n e^n + a_{n-1} e^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 e + a_0) = 0
\]

This implies that:

\[
a_n I e^n + a_{n-1} I e^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 I e + a_0 I = 0
\]

Since \( I \) is a non-zero integer (as shown by the properties of \( f(x) \)), this would imply that:

\[
a_n e^n + a_{n-1} e^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 e + a_0 = 0
\]

But we know from the construction of \( I \) that it cannot be zero, leading to a contradiction.

### Conclusion

Since assuming \( e \) is algebraic leads to a contradiction, \( e \) must be transcendental. Therefore, \( e \) is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients, and thus:

\[
e \text{ is transcendental}
\]

This completes the proof.
