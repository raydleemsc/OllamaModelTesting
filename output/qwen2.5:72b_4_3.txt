Certainly! Proving that \( e \) is transcendental (i.e., not a root of any non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients) is a significant result in mathematics, first proven by Charles Hermite in 1873. The proof involves complex analysis and the use of Liouville's theorem. Here is a high-level overview of the proof:

### Step-by-Step Proof

#### 1. **Preliminary Definitions and Setup**

- Let \( e \) be the base of the natural logarithm, defined by:
  \[
  e = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}
  \]

- Assume for contradiction that \( e \) is algebraic. This means there exists a non-zero polynomial \( P(x) \) with integer coefficients such that:
  \[
  P(e) = 0
  \]

#### 2. **Constructing the Polynomial**

- Let \( P(x) \) be of degree \( n \):
  \[
  P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
  \]
  where \( a_i \) are integers and \( a_n \neq 0 \).

#### 3. **Defining an Auxiliary Function**

- Define the auxiliary function:
  \[
  f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k e^{kx}
  \]
  where \( c_k \) are integers chosen such that:
  \[
  P(e^x) = f(x)
  \]

#### 4. **Using Complex Analysis**

- Consider the integral:
  \[
  I = \int_0^\infty e^{-t} t^n f(t) \, dt
  \]
  This integral can be evaluated using integration by parts and properties of \( e^t \).

#### 5. **Evaluating the Integral**

- By evaluating the integral, we obtain:
  \[
  I = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k \int_0^\infty e^{-t} t^n e^{kt} \, dt
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  I = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k \int_0^\infty e^{-(1-k)t} t^n \, dt
  \]

- Using the Gamma function \( \Gamma(n+1) = n! \), we have:
  \[
  I = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k (1-k)^{-(n+1)} n!
  \]

#### 6. **Contradiction**

- If \( e \) were algebraic, then the integral \( I \) would be an integer multiple of \( n! \). However, by carefully choosing the coefficients \( c_k \), we can show that \( I \) is not an integer.

- Specifically, if \( P(e) = 0 \), then:
  \[
  f(1) = 0
  \]
  which implies:
  \[
  I = 0
  \]

- This leads to a contradiction because the integral \( I \) cannot be zero for all choices of \( c_k \).

#### 7. **Conclusion**

- Therefore, our assumption that \( e \) is algebraic must be false. Hence, \( e \) is transcendental.

### Final Statement

The proof shows that \( e \) cannot satisfy any non-zero polynomial equation with integer coefficients, thus proving that \( e \) is transcendental. This result was a significant breakthrough in number theory and has far-reaching implications in mathematics.
