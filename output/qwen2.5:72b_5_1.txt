\section{Introduction to Topology}
Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing.

\section{Basic Definitions}

\subsection{Topological Space}
\begin{definition}[Topological Space]
A \emph{topological space} is a pair $(X, \tau)$ where $X$ is a set and $\tau$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ (called \emph{open sets}) such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The empty set $\emptyset$ and the entire set $X$ are in $\tau$.
    \item Any union of elements of $\tau$ is in $\tau$.
    \item Any finite intersection of elements of $\tau$ is in $\tau$.
\end{enumerate}
The collection $\tau$ is called a \emph{topology} on $X$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Closed Sets}
\begin{definition}[Closed Set]
A subset $C$ of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is \emph{closed} if its complement $X \setminus C$ is open.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Interior and Closure}
\begin{definition}[Interior]
The \emph{interior} of a set $A \subseteq X$, denoted by $\text{int}(A)$, is the union of all open sets contained in $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closure]
The \emph{closure} of a set $A \subseteq X$, denoted by $\overline{A}$, is the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Neighborhood}
\begin{definition}[Neighborhood]
A subset $N$ of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is a \emph{neighborhood} of a point $x \in X$ if there exists an open set $U$ such that $x \in U \subseteq N$.
\end{definition}

\section{Basic Theorems and Corollaries}

\subsection{Continuity}
\begin{theorem}[Continuous Function]
A function $f: (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ between topological spaces is \emph{continuous} if for every open set $V \in \tau_Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is in $\tau_X$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Sequential Continuity]
A function $f: (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ is continuous if and only if for every sequence $(x_n)$ in $X$ that converges to a point $x \in X$, the sequence $(f(x_n))$ converges to $f(x)$.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Homeomorphism}
\begin{definition}[Homeomorphism]
A function $f: (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ is a \emph{homeomorphism} if it is bijective and both $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ are continuous. Two spaces are \emph{homeomorphic} if there exists a homeomorphism between them.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Homeomorphism Theorem]
If two topological spaces $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ are homeomorphic, then they have the same topological properties.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Compactness}
\begin{definition}[Compact Set]
A subset $K$ of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is \emph{compact} if every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover. That is, for any collection $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ of open sets such that $K \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, there exists a finite subset $J \subseteq I$ such that $K \subseteq \bigcup_{j \in J} U_j$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Heine-Borel Theorem]
In $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard topology, a subset is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Connectedness}
\begin{definition}[Connected Set]
A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is \emph{connected} if it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. A subset $A$ of a topological space is \emph{connected} if it is connected in the subspace topology.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Connectedness Theorem]
If a continuous function maps a connected space to another topological space, then its image is also connected.
\end{theorem}
