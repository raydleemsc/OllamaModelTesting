\section{Basic Definitions}

\begin{definition}[Topology]
A \textbf{topology} on a set \( X \) is a collection \( \tau \) of subsets of \( X \), called \textbf{open sets}, such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The empty set \( \emptyset \) and the whole set \( X \) are in \( \tau \).
    \item The union of any collection of sets in \( \tau \) is also in \( \tau \).
    \item The intersection of any finite number of sets in \( \tau \) is also in \( \tau \).
\end{enumerate}
The pair \( (X, \tau) \) is called a \textbf{topological space}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closed Set]
A subset \( A \) of a topological space \( (X, \tau) \) is \textbf{closed} if its complement \( X \setminus A \) is open.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Interior and Closure]
Let \( (X, \tau) \) be a topological space and \( A \subseteq X \).
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{interior} of \( A \), denoted \( \operatorname{int}(A) \), is the union of all open sets contained in \( A \).
    \item The \textbf{closure} of \( A \), denoted \( \overline{A} \), is the intersection of all closed sets containing \( A \).
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Neighborhood]
A \textbf{neighborhood} of a point \( x \) in a topological space \( (X, \tau) \) is an open set \( U \) such that \( x \in U \).
\end{definition}

\section{Key Theorems and Corollaries}

\begin{theorem}[Characterization of Open Sets]
A subset \( A \subseteq X \) in a topological space \( (X, \tau) \) is open if and only if for every \( x \in A \), there exists an open set \( U \) such that \( x \in U \subseteq A \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Characterization of Closed Sets]
A subset \( A \subseteq X \) in a topological space \( (X, \tau) \) is closed if and only if its complement \( X \setminus A \) is open.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}[Closure Properties]
Let \( (X, \tau) \) be a topological space and \( A, B \subseteq X \).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \( A \subseteq \overline{A} \)
    \item \( A \subseteq B \implies \overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B} \)
    \item \( \overline{\overline{A}} = \overline{A} \)
    \item \( \overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B} \)
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Interior Properties]
Let \( (X, \tau) \) be a topological space and \( A, B \subseteq X \).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \( \operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \)
    \item \( A \subseteq B \implies \operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(B) \)
    \item \( \operatorname{int}(\operatorname{int}(A)) = \operatorname{int}(A) \)
    \item \( \operatorname{int}(A \cap B) = \operatorname{int}(A) \cap \operatorname{int}(B) \)
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Limit Point]
A point \( x \in X \) is a \textbf{limit point} of a subset \( A \subseteq X \) if every neighborhood of \( x \) contains at least one point of \( A \) different from \( x \).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Closure and Limit Points]
The closure \( \overline{A} \) of a set \( A \) is the union of \( A \) and its limit points.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Hausdorff Space]
A topological space \( (X, \tau) \) is called a \textbf{Hausdorff space} if for any two distinct points \( x, y \in X \), there exist disjoint open sets \( U \) and \( V \) such that \( x \in U \) and \( y \in V \).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Properties of Hausdorff Spaces]
In a Hausdorff space:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every finite subset is closed.
    \item The limit of a convergent sequence is unique.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\section{Common Topologies}

\begin{definition}[Discrete Topology]
The \textbf{discrete topology} on a set \( X \) is the topology where every subset of \( X \) is open.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Indiscrete Topology]
The \textbf{indiscrete topology} (or trivial topology) on a set \( X \) is the topology where the only open sets are \( \emptyset \) and \( X \).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Subspace Topology]
Let \( (X, \tau) \) be a topological space and \( Y \subseteq X \). The \textbf{subspace topology} on \( Y \) is the collection of sets of the form \( U \cap Y \), where \( U \in \tau \).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Product Topology]
Let \( (X_i, \tau_i) \) be a family of topological spaces indexed by \( i \in I \). The \textbf{product topology} on the Cartesian product \( X = \prod_{i \in I} X_i \) is the coarsest topology such that the projection maps \( \pi_i: X \to X_i \) are continuous.
\end{definition}

### Instructions to Compile
1. Save the above code to a file with a `.tex` extension, for example, `topology_cheat_sheet.tex`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Run the following commands to compile the document:
   ```sh
   lualatex topology_cheat_sheet.tex
   ```
5. If necessary, run the above command multiple times to resolve cross-references.

This will generate a PDF file named `topology_cheat_sheet.pdf` which you can open and use as a reference for basic topology concepts.
