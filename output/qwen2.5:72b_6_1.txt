Certainly! Below is an example of how you can create an animation using ManimGL (a community-maintained version of Manim) that transitions a triangle into a circle. This script will use the `Transform` method to morph one shape into another.

First, make sure you have ManimGL installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install manimgl
```

Then, create a Python file (e.g., `triangle_to_circle.py`) and add the following code:

```python
from manimlib.imports import *

class TriangleToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a triangle
        triangle = Polygon(
            ORIGIN, 1.5 * UP + 0.866 * LEFT, 1.5 * UP + 0.866 * RIGHT,
            color=BLUE
        )

        # Create a circle with the same area as the triangle for smooth transition
        circle_area = (3**0.5 / 4) * (2 * 1.5)**2  # Area of an equilateral triangle with side length 3
        circle_radius = (circle_area / math.pi)**0.5
        circle = Circle(radius=circle_radius, color=BLUE)

        # Add the triangle to the scene
        self.add(triangle)
        self.wait(1)  # Wait for 1 second

        # Transition from triangle to circle
        self.play(Transform(triangle, circle))
        self.wait(1)  # Wait for 1 second after the transformation
```

To run this script, use the following command:

```bash
manimgl triangle_to_circle.py TriangleToCircle -p
```

This command will render the animation and open a window to display it. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Import ManimGL**: We import the necessary modules from `manimlib.imports`.
2. **Create a Scene Class**: Define a class `TriangleToCircle` that inherits from `Scene`.
3. **Construct Method**: Inside the `construct` method:
   - Create a triangle using the `Polygon` class.
   - Calculate the area of the triangle and use it to determine the radius of the circle for a smooth transition.
   - Create a circle with the calculated radius.
   - Add the triangle to the scene and wait for 1 second.
   - Use the `Transform` method to morph the triangle into the circle.
   - Wait for another 1 second after the transformation.

This will create an animation where a blue equilateral triangle smoothly transitions into a blue circle. Adjust the colors, sizes, and timing as needed to fit your specific requirements.
