Certainly! Below is an example of how you can create an animation using `ManimGL` (a version of Manim for creating mathematical animations) that transitions a triangle into a circle.

First, make sure you have `ManimGL` installed. You can install it via pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install manimgl
```

Here's the code to create the animation:

```python
from manimlib.imports import *

class TriangleToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a triangle
        triangle = Polygon(
            np.array([-1, -1, 0]),
            np.array([1, -1, 0]),
            np.array([0, 1, 0])
        )
        
        # Create a circle with the same area as the triangle
        circle_area = (3**0.5) / 4  # Area of an equilateral triangle with side length 2
        radius = (circle_area / math.pi)**0.5
        circle = Circle(radius=radius)
        
        # Set the color and opacity for better visualization
        triangle.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.7)
        circle.set_fill(RED, opacity=0.7)

        # Add the triangle to the scene
        self.play(FadeIn(triangle))
        
        # Transition the triangle into a circle
        self.play(Transform(triangle, circle), run_time=2)
        
        # Fade out the circle
        self.play(FadeOut(circle))

# To run this animation, you can use the following command in your terminal:
# manimgl your_script_name.py TriangleToCircle
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import ManimGL**: We import the necessary modules from `manimlib.imports`.

2. **Create a Scene Class**: Define a class `TriangleToCircle` that inherits from `Scene`.

3. **Construct Method**:
   - **Create a Triangle**: Use `Polygon` to create a triangle with vertices at specific coordinates.
   - **Create a Circle**: Calculate the area of the triangle and use it to determine the radius of the circle that has the same area. Then, create the circle using `Circle`.
   - **Set Colors and Opacity**: Set the fill color and opacity for both the triangle and the circle for better visualization.
   - **Add the Triangle**: Use `FadeIn` to add the triangle to the scene.
   - **Transition**: Use `Transform` to animate the transition from the triangle to the circle. The `run_time` parameter controls how long the transformation takes.
   - **Fade Out**: Use `FadeOut` to remove the circle from the scene.

### Running the Animation:

To run this animation, save the code in a file (e.g., `triangle_to_circle.py`) and use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
manimgl triangle_to_circle.py TriangleToCircle
```

This will generate the animation and display it. You can also export the video by adding the `-o` flag followed by the output filename:

```bash
manimgl triangle_to_circle.py TriangleToCircle -o transition_animation
```

This will save the animation as a video file named `transition_animation.mp4`.
