The Markov numbers are a sequence of integers that appear in solutions to the Markov equation, which is defined as:

x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz

where x, y, and z are integers. The sequence of Markov numbers starts with 1, and each subsequent number is found by solving the equation for a new triple (x, y, z) where z is minimal among all newly found triples.

The first few Markov numbers are: 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 70, ...

The 7th Markov number corresponds to the next integer in this sequence. If we continue the sequence based on the known pattern of generating Markov triples, the 7th Markov number is 169.

This is part of a sequence derived from the first few steps of solving the Markov equation iteratively:

1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3*1*1*1
1, 2 (from the next solution)
...
Eventually, reaching the 7th number through the process:
1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 70, 169

Please note that while the method to find Markov numbers is clear, listing them manually beyond the initial few can be tedious and typically requires an algorithmic approach. The sequence provided here follows the pattern correctly for the initial values and includes 169 as the 7th Markov number based on that pattern.
