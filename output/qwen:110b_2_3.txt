The Markov numbers are a sequence of integers that arise in the context of Markov's Diophantine equation, which is an equation related to the study of quadratic forms. The equation for the Markov numbers specifically is:

\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \]

The sequence of Markov numbers starts with 1 and consists of the smallest positive integers \(x, y,\) and \(z\) that satisfy this equation in various combinations, such that each number appears exactly once in each solution triple (up to permutation).

The first few Markov numbers are: 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 70...

To get the 7th Markov number, we continue the sequence. However, I directly stated some of them initially. Let's clarify and extend the sequence correctly:

1. (1, 1, 1)
2. (1, 2, 5)
3. (1, 5, 13)
4. (2, 5, 29)
5. (1, 13, 70)
6. (5, 13, 169)
7. (2, 29, 433)

So, the 7th Markov number is 433.
