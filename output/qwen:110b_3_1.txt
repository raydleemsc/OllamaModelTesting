The toy you're describing sounds very similar to a "Fidget Spinner," which became extremely popular in the mid-2010s as a stress-relieving toy. However, a 6-pronged spinning toy more specifically might refer to a "Spinning Top" or a variant of a "Yo-Yo." If it's a particular type with metal construction and prongs designed for spinning, it could be a specialized spinning top that doesn't have a widely known specific name but would fall into the category of skill toys or gyroscopes. Another possible, albeit less common, toy it might resemble is a "Metal Finger Spinner," which is a variation on the Fidget Spinner with multiple prongs for finger placement.
