The toy you're describing sounds very similar to a "Finger Spinner" or "Hand Spinner," which became popular in the mid-2010s as a stress-relieving gadget. However, based on the specific description of a 6-pronged metal piece, it might be more akin to a combination of a finger spinner and a traditional spinning top. Here are some potential names for toys that could correspond to your description:

1. "Hex Spin Pro" - Combining 'hex' for six prongs and 'spin' for the action.
2. "Metallic Whirlwind" - Implies a spinning toy made of metal with a dynamic motion.
3. "Six-Pronged Cyclone" - Describes the number of prongs and spinning action.
4. "Spinetta Starweb" - A playful name suggesting a star-shaped spinner with multiple points.
5. "Pronged Pulsar" - Using 'pulsar' for its spinning nature, this implies a cosmic-themed toy.
6. "Mystical Spinneret" - A mix of 'spinner' and 'spider's web,' suggesting intricate design.
7. "Rota-Six" - Simple name combining 'rotate' with the number six.
8. "Harmony Hex-spinner" - Implies balance and symmetry in spinning action.
9. "Spinnerogue" - A playful blend of 'spinner' and 'rogue', giving it a bit of an adventurous flair.
10. "Whirling Star Spinner" - Highlighting its star-like shape with spinning motion.
