The toy you're describing sounds very similar to a "Fidget Spinner," which became extremely popular in the mid-2010s as a stress-relieving and fidgeting device. However, based on the specific description with a 6-pronged metal piece, it might not exactly match the typical Fidget Spinner design, which often has a central bearing with two or three arms. 

A toy that more closely matches your description could be referred to as a "Spinning Top," but typically spinning tops have a different shape and are not necessarily pronged. If we're looking for something more akin to what you described, here are a few potential names or variations that could correspond:

1. **Hexagonal Fidget Spinner**: A specialized fidget spinner with six arms or prongs.
2. **Metallic Star Spinner**: Imagining a design where the spinning element resembles a star with six points.
3. **Pronged Spin Top**: A blend between a traditional spinning top and a fidget toy, featuring six prongs for balance and spin.
4. **Six-WingedSpinner**: Referring to the toy's design as if it had six wings that rotate around a center.
5. **stellar Spinner**: Playfully named for its star-like appearance when spinning.

Keep in mind that these are fictional names based on your description, as there might not be an exact, widely recognized toy with that specific configuration. If this is a real toy but less well-known or from a particular culture or era, it could have local or niche-specific naming.
