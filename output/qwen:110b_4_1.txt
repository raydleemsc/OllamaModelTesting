The transcendence of the constant e, which is approximately equal to 2.71828, was first proved by Charles Hermite in 1873. The proof is quite complex and relies on advanced techniques from mathematical analysis and number theory. I'll outline a high-level sketch of the proof, but please note that the full proof involves several intricate steps and requires a solid background in mathematics.

**Goal**: Prove that e is not a solution to any non-trivial polynomial equation with rational coefficients, i.e., e is transcendental.

The general strategy for proving the transcendence of a number involves assuming the contrary and then reaching a contradiction. Here's an outline of Hermite's approach:

1. **Liouville's Theorem Application**: Though Hermite's proof predates Liouville's theorem on transcendental numbers, it employs similar ideas. One key step involves constructing a function that satisfies certain properties related to the assumed algebraic nature of e and then showing that this leads to a contradiction.

2. **Difference Equations and Power Series**: Start by considering power series or functions closely related to e, often involving exponential functions or their derivatives, as these have natural connections with e.

3. **Differential Equations**: Hermite worked with the differential equation satisfied by the exponential function and its properties, specifically looking at how such equations could be manipulated to create a polynomial approximation.

4. **Estimation and Contradiction**: He estimated the growth rate of certain functions related to e and showed that if e were algebraic, these estimates would lead to a contradiction in terms of the closeness of integer polynomials to e.

5. **Orthogonality and Polynomials**: Hermite introduced polynomial approximations and used their properties, sometimes invoking the concept of "orthogonality," to show that any polynomial approximation to e^x (around x=0) cannot match e exactly for non-trivial cases due to the specific growth behavior of e's Taylor series.

6. **Complex Analysis**: Complex analysis tools, like contour integration or Fourier series manipulations, were also integral parts of Hermite's proof, as they allowed him to analyze functions more precisely and establish bounds that eventually lead to the contradiction.

The actual proof involves heavy mathematical machinery, including infinite series manipulation, properties of analytic functions, and clever constructions tailored specifically for e. Due to its complexity, it is not easily summarized in a few paragraphs, but this sketch gives you an idea of the involved strategy. For a detailed proof, one would consult advanced texts on transcendental number theory or historical mathematical papers by Hermite himself.
