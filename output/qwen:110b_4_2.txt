The transcendence of the number e, which is approximately equal to 2.71828, was first proven by Charles Hermite in 1873. The proof is quite involved and relies on advanced techniques from mathematical analysis, specifically the theory of power series and polynomial equations. Here's a simplified outline of the main idea behind Hermite's proof, which does not provide all the details but gives you an idea of its structure:

1. **Assume for contradiction**: Assume that e is algebraic, meaning it can be expressed as a root of a nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients. That is, there exist integers \(a_0, a_1, ..., a_n\) (not all zero) such that
\[a_0 + a_1e + a_2e^2 + \cdots + a_ne^n = 0\]
with the coefficients being rational.

2. **Use Power Series**: Consider the power series representations of functions related to e, such as \(e^x\) and its derivatives. In particular, focus on functions whose values at integer multiples of e give rise to polynomials with a structure that can be manipulated due to the assumed algebraicity of e.

3. **Lagrange's Interpolation Formula or Difference Equations**: Hermite used techniques involving interpolation formulas or studied difference equations related to these power series. The goal here is to construct a polynomial, say \(P(x)\), with rational coefficients that behaves in a specific way when evaluated at integer multiples of e.

4. **Create a Contradiction**: Through careful analysis and manipulation of these polynomials and their evaluations at powers of e, Hermite aimed to show that there would be a nontrivial polynomial (with rational coefficients) whose evaluation at zero yields a nonzero rational number, but the construction or properties of this polynomial lead to a contradiction with the initial algebraic assumption.

5. **Analytic Properties**: The contradiction often arises from examining the growth rate of these polynomials or the behavior of their values compared to the assumed relation involving e. This demonstrates that the initial assumption that e is algebraic leads to a situation that cannot be true, thereby proving by contradiction that e must be transcendental.

This outline is highly simplified and the actual proof involves intricate manipulations and deep results from number theory and analysis. For a full understanding, one would need to delve into the specifics of Hermite's work or subsequent simpler proofs that have been developed with more modern notation and techniques.
