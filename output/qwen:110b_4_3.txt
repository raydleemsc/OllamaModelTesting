The transcendence of the number e, which is approximately equal to 2.71828, was first proved by Charles Hermite in 1873. The proof is quite complex and relies on advanced mathematical techniques, particularly from the fields of analysis and algebra. Here's an outline of the general strategy rather than a full formal proof, which would be beyond the scope for most casual readers:

1. **Definition of e**: The number e is defined as the limit of (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity or through its Taylor series expansion: e = ∑(n=0 to infinity) [1/n!].

2. **Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem**: A crucial tool in proving the transcendence of certain numbers like e and π is the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, which states that if α is a non-zero algebraic number (a root of a non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients), then e^α is transcendental. This theorem is a part of the field of diophantine approximation.

3. **Strategy**: To prove that e is transcendental, one indirectly assumes that e is algebraic and arrives at a contradiction using techniques from the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem or related ideas.

4. **Contradiction via Power Series**: One approach involves examining the power series representation of e^x and the function f(x) = e^x - x - 1. If e were algebraic, then functions like these would satisfy certain polynomial relationships with integer coefficients. However, by manipulating derivatives and applying properties of algebraic numbers, one shows that this cannot be the case for a power series expansion consistent with e being algebraic.

5. **Application of Analytic Tools**: Using analytic properties of the exponential function, it's shown that under the assumption that e is algebraic, certain expressions involving e would violate the unique factorization property or lead to a system of equations that has no solution, thus contradicting the initial assumption.

Please note that the actual proof involves deep and intricate mathematical arguments, including manipulating infinite series and advanced properties of polynomials. It's not a straightforward demonstration and requires a solid understanding of complex analysis and algebraic number theory. For a complete and rigorous proof, consult an advanced mathematics text or specialized literature on transcendental number theory.
