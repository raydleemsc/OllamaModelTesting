I'm sorry, as an AI text-based model, I can't directly create or display visual content like animations. However, I can provide you with the basic steps and a rough script on how you might describe this transformation using Manim (a mathematical animation library in Python). If you have programming experience, you could take these guidelines to create the animation yourself.

Here's a simplified script idea:

```python
from manimlib.imports import *

class TransformTriangleToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a triangle
        triangle = RegularPolygon(n=3, start_angle=0, color=RED).scale(1)
        self.play(ShowCreation(triangle))
        
        # Wait a beat for the viewer to see the triangle
        self.wait(1)

        # Define an intermediary shape if needed for smooth transition (optional)
        intermediate_shape = Polygon([-2, -1, 0], [2, -1, 0], [0, 2, 0], color=YELLOW).scale(0.5) 
        self.play(Transform(triangle, intermediate_shape))
        
        # Transform triangle into a circle
        circle = Circle(color=BLUE)
        self.play(Transform(triangle, circle), run_time=2)

        # Hold the final image for a bit
        self.wait(2)
```

Please note:
- You need to have Manim properly installed and set up in your Python environment to run this script.
- `RegularPolygon(n=3)` creates a triangle. The `n` parameter specifies the number of sides; for a circle, you'd use a high number or consider using `Circle()` directly, but here we're demonstrating a transformation from a literal triangle shape.
- `ShowCreation`, `Transform`, and `Wait` are commands to show creation, transform one mobject into another, and pause the animation respectively.
- The color and scale are arbitrary choices for demonstration.

Remember, Manim animations often require fine-tuning parameters (like the path of the transformation or interpolation method) for a smooth and visually pleasing result.
