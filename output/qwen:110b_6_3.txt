As an AI language model, I cannot directly create or display visual content like Manim animations, but I can provide you with a Python code snippet that you would use in the Manim library to achieve the desired effect. You will need to have Manim installed on your system to run this code.

Here's a basic example of how you might transition from a triangle to a circle using Manim:

```python
from manim import *

class ShapeTransition(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a triangle
        triangle = Polygon(LEFT, RIGHT, UP, stroke_width=1, fill_opacity=0.5, color=YELLOW)
        
        # Display the triangle for some time
        self.play(ShowCreation(triangle))
        self.wait(2)  # Wait for 2 seconds
        
        # Transition (FadeOut the triangle and FadeIn a circle)
        circle = Circle(radius=triangle.get_width() / 2, stroke_width=1, fill_opacity=0.5, color=BLUE)
        
        # You can use Transform to animate from one shape to another directly,
        # but since a circle cannot directly transform into a triangle with Manim's built-in transforms,
        # we'll fade out the triangle and then fade in the circle for demonstration purposes.
        self.play(FadeOut(triangle), run_time=2)
        self.wait(0.5)  # Small pause
        self.play(FadeIn(circle))
        
        self.wait(2)  # Display the circle for some time

# To run this, you would save it to a .py file and then use manim command to render the animation.
```

This code creates a scene where a triangle appears, stays on screen for a while, fades out, and is followed by a circle fading in. If you want a more direct transition effect that smoothly morphs the shape from a triangle into a circle, Manim might not have a built-in transform for it directly, but you can achieve complex transitions through custom animations or using techniques like interpolating vertices over time, which would be a bit more advanced and involve creating a custom animation class.
