A Markov number is a positive integer m which can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers starting from 1. It was proposed by the mathematician Andrey Markov.

The first few Markov numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, â€¦

In Python, we can find nth Markov number using a while loop as follows:

```python
def markov_number(n):
    markov_nums = [1]  # initialize with the first markov number.
    i = 2
    while len(markov_nums) < n:
        total = sum([i-j for j in range(i)])
        if total not in markov_nums:
            markov_nums.append(total)
        i += 1
    return markov_nums[-1]  # return the last number in list as it is the nth one.

print(markov_number(7)) # prints 7th Markov number
```

This code creates a list of all found Markov numbers and adds to it any new ones that are found by summing consecutive integers starting from 1 until it has found 'n' Markov numbers. It then returns the last number in this list, which is the nth Markov number.
