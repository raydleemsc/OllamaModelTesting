Several possible toys could correspond to this activity:

1. "Whirligig" is a toy with 6 prongs and the ability to spin. It's traditionally made from metal, and children would try to make it spin as fast as they can.

2. "Tai Chi" is an ancient form of exercise where one person holds a metronome-like hand fan (dragon fan) which features 6 points/prongs that can be used for spinning.

3. “Mazinger” is another metal toy with 6 prongs and a spinning mechanism, which kids could try to make spin faster than their opponents.

4. "Flying Disc" or "Kite", which is similar in appearance to a toy with 6 prongs, and could be used for spinning.

5. “Spinning Top” or “Tops” are another fun and classic party game that involves spinning a metal top with multiple points on it.

Remember though, always make sure any toys used for this activity are in good condition and free from any potential risks to children, such as sharp edges or moving parts.
