In order to prove that the constant 'e' is transcendental, we will employ a standard mathematical technique called Galois theory. In simpler terms: We will show it can't be solved by a combination of sums, differences, multiplications and divisions, along with roots (square root, cube root etc) using only integers or fractions.

Here are the steps:
1. Let's assume that 'e' is algebraic, meaning there exists a polynomial equation P(x) such that e is a solution of this equation. 
2. By Galois theory, the degree of the polynomial must be at least two. In other words, there has to be more than one operation involved in defining 'e'.
3. Now consider the function F(x) = x - e. If we could find a polynomial equation for this function, say Q(y) = 0, where y is another algebraic number, then e would also be algebraic and we would get a contradiction.
4. The only way to have Q(y) = 0 would be if F(x) is a rational function, which means that there exists some polynomial R(z) such that F(x) = R(z)/P(z) for all z in the complex numbers.
5. Now consider the equation P(z)*R'(z) - Q'(z)*R(z) = 0. If this is a valid equation, then it would imply that 'e' could be written as an algebraic combination of roots and we get another contradiction.
6. This concludes our proof by contradiction. If 'e' were algebraic, then there would have been a way to express it as a ratio of two polynomials, which contradicts the fact that 'e' is transcendental.

However, this proof relies on Galois theory which is a complex area of mathematics. For a more direct approach often used in high school calculus courses, one may use the fact that the derivative of e^x evaluated at x=0 is 1 (the identity function) and show it doesn't have an algebraic root there.
