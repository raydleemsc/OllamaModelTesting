Here is an example using the ManimationGL library, which is used for creating 3D animations with Python:

```python
from manim import *

class TriangleToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        triangle = Triangle()
        circle = Circle()

        self.play(Create(triangle))
        self.wait(1)
        self.play(ReplacementTransform(triangle, circle))
        self.wait(1)
```
In this code: 
- We start with importing the necessary module (manimgl) and class (Scene) from ManimGL library.
- Then we define our animation class `TriangleToCircle` which is a subclass of `Scene`, meaning it's an animation scene.
- Inside this class, in the `construct()` method that ManimGL automatically calls to build the scene, we create a triangle and play its creation on screen with `self.play(Create(triangle))`. We then wait for 1 second using `self.wait(1)`, and then replace the triangle with a circle using `ReplacementTransform(triangle, circle)`. Again we wait for another second before finishing our animation.
- You can run this code in your local environment to see how it works. Make sure you have ManimGL installed in your Python environment. 
  
Note: The above code will only work on systems which support rendering ManimGL animations.
